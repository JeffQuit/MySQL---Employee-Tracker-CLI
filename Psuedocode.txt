Assignment:
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Design the following DB Schema

department Table:
id - INT PRIMARY KEY
name - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

role Table:
id - INT PRIMARY KEY
title -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
salary -  DECIMAL to hold role salary
department_id -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to



employee Table:
id - INT PRIMARY KEY
first_name - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
last_name - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
role_id - INT to hold reference to role employee has
manager_id - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager


Steps:
1. Create db.sql formatted code to initialize the DB and 3 tables
